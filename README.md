# Modern Login Page (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

![Project Screenshot](src/screenshot.jpg)

## Project Description

This project is a clean, modern, and responsive front-end implementation of a login page. It's built using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to provide a sleek and user-friendly interface.

**Note:** This is a client-side demonstration focusing purely on the user interface and front-end validation (if implemented). It does **not** include any server-side authentication logic, database integration, or secure password handling.

## Features

* **Modern Design:** A visually appealing and contemporary look and feel.
* **Responsive Layout:** Adapts gracefully to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, mobile phones).
* **Pure HTML, CSS, JS:** Built without external libraries or frameworks (unless you added them, specify below).
* **Client-Side Validation:** Basic input validation using JavaScript (e.g., checking if fields are empty, basic format checks - *mention specific checks if you implemented them*).
* **Easy to Customize:** Well-structured HTML and CSS make it easy to modify the appearance.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (Vanilla JS)

*(Add any other specific technologies if you used them, e.g., Font Awesome for icons, Google Fonts, etc.)*

## Getting Started

To view or use this project locally, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository)*

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
    *(Replace `your-repository-name` with the name of your cloned directory)*

3.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

## Usage

* Open `index.html` in a web browser.
* The page will display the login form.
* Enter (placeholder) credentials.
* Clicking the "Login" button will trigger the client-side JavaScript validation you've implemented.
* *(Again, reiterate that this does not connect to a backend or perform actual login)*
